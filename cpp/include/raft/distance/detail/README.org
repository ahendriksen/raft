- [X] Euclidean
  - *Notes*:
    - enable_sqrt is now a runtime parameter. Was it a compile time
      parameter before?
    - CUTLASS fails on CUDA 12 (but prior to refactoring CUDA 12 did not work
      either). I have not yet tested if everything works correctly on CUDA 11.
- [X] canberra.cuh
- [X] chebyshev.cuh
- [X] correlation.cuh
- [X] cosine.cuh
  - *Notes*: cutlass fails on CUDA 12 (but prior to refactoring CUDA 12 did not

- [X] hellinger.cuh
- [X] jensen_shannon.cuh
- [X] kl_divergence.cuh
  - *Notes*: the isRowMajor and x_equal_y boolean parameters where previously
    template / constexpr parameters. Now they are passed by value. This greatly
    reduces the number of kernels, but may have negative consequences for run
    time.
