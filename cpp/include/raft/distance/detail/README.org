- [X] Euclidean
  - *Notes*: isRowMajor is now a runtime parameter. Was it a compile time
    parameter before?

- [X] chebyshev.cuh
- [X] correlation.cuh
- [ ] cosine.cuh
- [X] hamming.cuh
- [X] hellinger.cuh
- [X] jensen_shannon.cuh
- [X] kl_divergence.cuh
  - *Notes*: the isRowMajor and x_equal_y boolean parameters where previously
    template / constexpr parameters. Now they are passed by value. This greatly
    reduces the number of kernels, but may have negative consequences for run
    time.
